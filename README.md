üëã Hey there! I'm Jatan Kumar, a passionate REACT.js Front-End Software Developer with over 4 years of experience in the tech industry. I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving world of technology.

### About Me
- üåç Citizen of the World: Originally from Mozambique, I graduated in South Africa and currently work in Portugal. My diverse background enriches my perspective and approach to problem-solving.
- üéì Education: I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computer Sciences with a specialization in Application Development, as well as a Diploma in Information Sciences focused on Software Development.
- üíº Professional Journey: From disassembling school computers in grade 5 to freelancing as a React Front-End Developer and joining BOOST-I.T as a Web Developer/Web Analyst, my journey has been fueled by curiosity and a passion for technology.

### My Story
I've been immersed in technology since childhood. My journey began with hardware tinkering in grade 5, followed by building local websites with HTML and CSS in grade 8. Throughout high school, I delved deeper into information systems and pursued qualifications in Software Development and Computer and Information Sciences in Applications.

During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with a variety of technologies, from C# ASP .NET to PHP, Java, and Angular.js. I honed my skills in database management, system architecture design, and project management, setting a solid foundation for my career.

My professional career kicked off at Infinite Reality, a startup where I played a pivotal role as a React Frontend Developer. I contributed to creating development environments, developing applications with React, and collaborating on UI wireframes and project management using Agile Scrum Methodology.

After two fulfilling years, I transitioned to freelance work, converting wireframes into functional code as a React Front End Developer. Eventually, I joined BOOST-I.T as a Web Developer/Web Analyst, where I quickly adapted to new technologies like Adobe Launch and contributed effectively to various projects.
